\section{Numerical Methods}
\label{sec:numerics}

GANDALF employs Fourier spectral methods in all three spatial directions combined with an integrating factor time-stepping scheme specifically designed for the KRMHD equations. This approach delivers spectral accuracy in space---exponential convergence for smooth solutions---while handling the stiff linear \Alfven\ wave propagation exactly. The method proves particularly effective for turbulence simulations where accurate representation of nonlinear cascades across wide ranges of scales demands high-order spatial discretization.

\subsection{Fourier Spectral Discretization}

We discretize all spatial directions using Fourier spectral methods on a triply-periodic domain of size $L_x \times L_y \times L_z$. Each field (Elsasser potentials $\xi^\pm$ and Hermite moments $\gm{m}^{\pm}$) admits the Fourier representation
\begin{equation}
f(x,y,z,t) = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \hat{f}(\mathbf{k},t) e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}},
\label{eq:fourier_representation}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$ with wavenumbers $k_x = 2\pi n_x/L_x$, $k_y = 2\pi n_y/L_y$, $k_z = 2\pi n_z/L_z$ for integer mode numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$. The real-space grid contains $N_x \times N_y \times N_z$ collocation points with spacing $\Delta x = L_x/N_x$, $\Delta y = L_y/N_y$, $\Delta z = L_z/N_z$.

GANDALF implements fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) via JAX's \texttt{jnp.fft} module, exploiting the reality of physical fields through real-to-complex transforms (\texttt{rfftn}) that compute only non-negative frequencies in the $x$-direction. This optimization reduces memory usage by approximately 50\% compared to full complex transforms while automatically satisfying the reality condition $\hat{f}(-\mathbf{k}) = \hat{f}^*(\mathbf{k})$.

Spatial derivatives become exact multiplications in Fourier space:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j} \longleftrightarrow ik_j\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}),
\label{eq:spectral_derivative}
\end{equation}
yielding zero truncation error for band-limited functions. The perpendicular Laplacian and Poisson bracket from Eq.~\eqref{eq:elsasser} thus acquire simple forms:
\begin{align}
\nabla^2_\perp f &\longleftrightarrow -(k_x^2 + k_y^2)\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) = -\kperp^2\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}),
\label{eq:laplacian_spectral}
\\
\widehat{\pb{P}{Q}} &= i\left(k_x \hat{P} \star k_y\hat{Q} - k_y\hat{P} \star k_x\hat{Q}\right),
\label{eq:poisson_bracket_spectral}
\end{align}
where $\star$ denotes convolution. Evaluation of the Poisson bracket requires transforming $P$ and $Q$ to real space, computing the product of derivatives, and transforming back to Fourier space---the pseudospectral approach that necessitates dealiasing (\S\ref{sec:dealiasing}).

For typical turbulence simulations with resolution $128^3$ to $256^3$, the spectral method resolves maximum wavenumbers (after 2/3 dealiasing) up to $k_{\perp,\text{max}} \rhoi \sim 1$, capturing the transition from fluid-like MHD scales to kinetic-scale dynamics where ion Larmor radius effects become important \citep{Howes2008,TenBarge2013}.

\subsection{GANDALF Integrating Factor Method}

Direct time integration of the KRMHD equations encounters severe stiffness from the linear \Alfven\ wave terms $\mp \vA \partial/\partial z$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:elsasser}, which propagate at the fast \Alfven\ velocity $\vA$ and impose restrictive CFL conditions. GANDALF removes this stiffness through an integrating factor transformation that treats linear propagation exactly while advancing nonlinear interactions with a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme.

\subsubsection{Integrating Factor Transformation}

The Elsasser equations~\eqref{eq:elsasser} in Fourier space separate into linear propagation and nonlinear forcing:
\begin{equation}
\pardt \nabla^2_\perp \hat{\xi}^\pm \mp i k_z \vA \nabla^2_\perp \hat{\xi}^\pm = \widehat{\mathcal{N}[\xi^+,\xi^-]},
\label{eq:elsasser_fourier}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}$ represents the nonlinear Poisson bracket terms. Defining the perpendicular vorticity variables $\hat{w}^\pm = \nabla^2_\perp \hat{\xi}^\pm = -\kperp^2 \hat{\xi}^\pm$ and applying the integrating factor $\exp(\pm i k_z \vA t)$ yields
\begin{equation}
\pardt \left[e^{\mp i k_z \vA t} \hat{w}^\pm\right] = e^{\mp i k_z \vA t} \widehat{\mathcal{N}[\xi^+,\xi^-]}.
\label{eq:integrating_factor_form}
\end{equation}
This transformation exactly removes the oscillatory linear terms, permitting time steps controlled by the slower nonlinear evolution rather than wave propagation.

\subsubsection{Second-Order Time Stepping}

GANDALF advances the transformed variables using a midpoint (second-order Runge-Kutta) scheme. The phase factors $\exp(\pm ik_z\vA\Delta t)$ appear \emph{twice} in each update: once from the integrating factor transformation and once from integrating the nonlinear terms. Given state $(\hat{w}^+_n, \hat{w}^-_n, \{\hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n}\})$ at time $t_n$, we compute:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{GANDALF Time Step $t_n \to t_{n+1} = t_n + \Delta t$}
\label{alg:gandalf_step}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Half-step predictor:}
\STATE Compute nonlinear RHS: $\mathcal{N}_n = \mathcal{N}[\xi^+_n, \xi^-_n]$
\STATE Apply integrating factors (note: phase factor appears twice):
\begin{align*}
\hat{w}^+_{n+1/2} &= e^{+ik_z\vA\Delta t/2}\left(\hat{w}^+_n + e^{+ik_z\vA\Delta t/2} \frac{\Delta t}{2} \widehat{\mathcal{N}_n^+}\right), \\
\hat{w}^-_{n+1/2} &= e^{-ik_z\vA\Delta t/2}\left(\hat{w}^-_n + e^{-ik_z\vA\Delta t/2} \frac{\Delta t}{2} \widehat{\mathcal{N}_n^-}\right)
\end{align*}
\STATE Hermite moments (no integrating factor):
\[
\hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n+1/2} = \hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n} + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \widehat{\mathcal{H}^{\pm}_{m,n}}
\]
\STATE \textbf{Midpoint evaluation:}
\STATE Compute $\mathcal{N}_{n+1/2} = \mathcal{N}[\xi^+_{n+1/2}, \xi^-_{n+1/2}]$ and $\mathcal{H}^{\pm}_{m,n+1/2}$
\STATE \textbf{Full-step corrector:}
\STATE Apply integrating factors with midpoint RHS:
\begin{align*}
\hat{w}^+_{n+1} &= e^{+ik_z\vA\Delta t}\left(\hat{w}^+_n + e^{+ik_z\vA\Delta t} \Delta t \, \widehat{\mathcal{N}_{n+1/2}^+}\right), \\
\hat{w}^-_{n+1} &= e^{-ik_z\vA\Delta t}\left(\hat{w}^-_n + e^{-ik_z\vA\Delta t} \Delta t \, \widehat{\mathcal{N}_{n+1/2}^-}\right)
\end{align*}
\STATE Hermite moments:
\[
\hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n+1} = \hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n} + \Delta t \, \widehat{\mathcal{H}^{\pm}_{m,n+1/2}}
\]
\STATE \textbf{Apply dissipation} (see \S\ref{sec:dissipation})
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Here $\mathcal{H}^{\pm}_m$ denotes the right-hand side of the Hermite moment hierarchy Eqs.~\eqref{eq:moment_hierarchy}, including advection, phase mixing, and collisions. The phase factors $\exp(\pm ik_z\vA\Delta t)$ appear \emph{twice} in each update (once from the transformation, once from integration), giving the characteristic structure of the GANDALF method \citep{Numata2010}.

\subsubsection{Stability and Time Step Selection}

The integrating factor removes the \Alfven\ wave CFL \emph{stability} restriction, but accuracy considerations for the second-order nonlinear integration still require time steps that resolve wave propagation timescales. GANDALF computes adaptive time steps satisfying
\begin{equation}
\Delta t \leq C \frac{\min(\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)}{\max(\vA, |\mathbf{v}_\perp|_\text{max})},
\label{eq:cfl_condition}
\end{equation}
where $|\mathbf{v}_\perp|_\text{max} = \max|\nabla_\perp \Phifield|$ measures the maximum perpendicular $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ velocity and the safety factor $C = 0.3$ accounts for the second-order method. The integrating factor removes the \emph{parallel} \Alfven\ wave CFL restriction ($\Delta t < \Delta z/\vA$), but the overall time step remains limited by the \emph{perpendicular} advection CFL and accuracy requirements for resolving nonlinear dynamics. For typical anisotropic turbulence simulations with $\Delta x \sim \Delta y \ll \Delta z$, the perpendicular grid spacing controls the time step.

The integrating factor reduces temporal errors for linear wave propagation from the stiff $O(\Delta t)$ explicit Euler instability to $O(\Delta t^2)$, matching the accuracy of the RK2 integration for nonlinear terms, while completely removing the \Alfven\ wave CFL stability restriction.

\subsection{Dissipation}
\label{sec:dissipation}

Physical dissipation enters GANDALF through magnetic diffusion (resistivity) for the Elsasser fields and collisions for the Hermite moments. Rather than adding explicit dissipation terms to the right-hand side, GANDALF applies exponential damping factors exactly after each time step.

For the Elsasser vorticities, resistive diffusion $\eta\nabla^2_\perp$ becomes
\begin{equation}
\hat{w}^\pm_{n+1} \to \hat{w}^\pm_{n+1} \exp\left(-\eta \kperp^2 \Delta t\right)
\label{eq:resistive_damping}
\end{equation}
in Fourier space. To enhance stability at high wavenumbers while minimizing dissipation in the inertial range, GANDALF employs normalized hyper-resistivity:
\begin{equation}
\hat{w}^\pm_{n+1} \to \hat{w}^\pm_{n+1} \exp\left[-\eta \left(\frac{\kperp^2}{k^2_{\perp,\text{max}}}\right)^r \Delta t\right],
\label{eq:hyper_resistivity}
\end{equation}
where $k^2_{\perp,\text{max}} = \max(k_x^2 + k_y^2)$ and the hyper-dissipation order $r \geq 1$ concentrates damping near the grid scale. Standard choices are $r=2$ (hyper-resistivity) or $r=4$ (ultra-hyper-resistivity). Normalization by $k^2_{\perp,\text{max}}$ ensures the stability constraint $\eta\Delta t < 50$ remains independent of resolution, simplifying parameter selection across different grid sizes.

Hermite moment collisions follow the Lenard-Bernstein form Eq.~\eqref{eq:collision_operator} with damping rate $m\coll$ for moment order $m$. GANDALF implements this as
\begin{equation}
\hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n+1} \to \hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n+1} \exp\left[-\coll \left(\frac{m}{\Mmax}\right)^{2p} \Delta t\right],
\label{eq:hermite_dissipation}
\end{equation}
where $\Mmax$ is the maximum moment order and hyper-collision exponent $p \geq 1$ concentrates dissipation at high moments. Standard values are $p=1$ (linear Lenard-Bernstein) or $p=2$ (hyper-collisions). This exact exponential integration preserves positivity and avoids instabilities from stiff collision terms.

\subsection{Dealiasing}
\label{sec:dealiasing}

Pseudospectral evaluation of nonlinear terms produces aliasing errors when products of Fourier modes exceed the Nyquist frequency. For KRMHD, the Poisson brackets in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:elsasser} and \eqref{eq:moment_hierarchy} involve products of fields whose wavenumbers can sum to values outside the resolved range. Without correction, aliased modes appear as low-frequency components, corrupting the solution and often causing catastrophic instability.

GANDALF applies the 2/3 dealiasing rule \citep{Orszag1971,Canuto2006}: after each nonlinear term evaluation, modes satisfying
\begin{equation}
\max\left(\frac{|k_x|}{k_{x,\text{max}}}, \frac{|k_y|}{k_{y,\text{max}}}, \frac{|k_z|}{k_{z,\text{max}}}\right) > \frac{2}{3}
\label{eq:dealiasing_rule}
\end{equation}
are set to zero. This ensures products of any two modes within the retained $2/3$ sphere remain representable on the grid, eliminating aliasing at the cost of reducing effective resolution from $N$ to approximately $2N/3$ modes.

The dealiasing mask is pre-computed during initialization and applied via pointwise multiplication in Fourier space, incurring negligible computational cost. For turbulence simulations where nonlinear energy transfer dominates, proper dealiasing proves essential for long-time numerical stability---unfiltered runs typically develop grid-scale oscillations within tens of eddy turnover times.

\subsection{Convergence Properties}

The spectral spatial discretization delivers exponential convergence for smooth solutions. For fields with $C^\infty$ regularity, spatial errors decay as $\mathcal{E}_\text{space} \sim \exp(-\alpha N)$ where $N = \min(N_x, N_y, N_z)$ characterizes the minimum grid resolution and $\alpha$ depends on the solution's analyticity radius \citep{Boyd2001}. This stands in contrast to finite-difference methods whose algebraic convergence ($\mathcal{E} \sim N^{-p}$) requires prohibitive resolution to achieve comparable accuracy for turbulent cascades spanning multiple decades in wavenumber.

Temporal convergence is $\mathcal{E}_\text{time} = O(\Delta t^2)$ for both linear and nonlinear terms. The GANDALF integrating factor scheme achieves second-order accuracy by matching the RK2 treatment of nonlinear terms with an appropriately constructed integrating factor for linear \Alfven\ wave propagation. Richardson extrapolation or adaptive time stepping can further reduce temporal errors when high accuracy is required, though turbulence simulations typically tolerate $1$--$2\%$ errors to maximize throughput.

The Hermite moment expansion exhibits spectral convergence in velocity space. For Maxwellian-like distributions, the energy contained in moments $m > \Mmax$ decays exponentially with $\Mmax$, permitting accurate representation with $\Mmax \sim 10$--$20$ moments \citep{Howes2006,TenBarge2013}. GANDALF monitors convergence via the energy ratio $E_{\Mmax}/E_\text{total}$ (energy in the highest retained moment relative to total energy), typically requiring this to fall below $10^{-3}$ to ensure negligible truncation errors from the $\gm{\Mmax+1}^{\pm} = 0$ closure condition.

Combined spatial-temporal-velocity convergence studies for standard benchmarks (Orszag-Tang vortex, decaying turbulence) demonstrate GANDALF achieves design accuracy: spectral spatial convergence, second-order temporal convergence, and exponential velocity-space convergence controlled by moment truncation. Energy conservation errors in collisionless runs remain below $0.01\%$ over hundreds of dynamical times, validating both the discretization and the energy-conserving properties of the GANDALF formulation \citep{Numata2010}.

\subsection{Computational Implementation}

GANDALF implements the above algorithms in JAX \citep{JAX2018}, a Python library providing automatic differentiation and just-in-time (JIT) compilation to optimized machine code. The JIT compiler transforms high-level spectral operations into efficient GPU or CPU kernels without manual low-level programming, enabling rapid development while maintaining competitive performance.

Key implementation features include:

\paragraph{JIT Compilation.} All core functions (time stepping, FFTs, nonlinear terms) are decorated with \texttt{@jax.jit}, triggering compilation to XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) intermediate representation and subsequent optimization. Static arguments (grid dimensions, moment orders) are compile-time constants, permitting aggressive loop unrolling and specialization.

\paragraph{Hardware Portability.} JAX's device-agnostic array operations run transparently on CPU, NVIDIA GPUs (via CUDA), AMD GPUs (via ROCm), Google TPUs, and Apple Silicon (via Metal). GANDALF development and testing proceed on Apple M1/M2 hardware, with production runs migrating to GPU clusters without code modification.

\paragraph{Functional Design.} JAX enforces pure functional programming: time-stepping functions return new state objects rather than mutating existing arrays. This immutability enables automatic parallelization and simplifies debugging, though requiring careful memory management for large simulations.

\paragraph{Pytree Structures.} GANDALF defines custom \texttt{KRMHDState} and \texttt{SpectralGrid} classes registered as JAX pytrees, allowing transformations (\texttt{jax.grad}, \texttt{jax.vmap}, \texttt{jax.scan}) to operate on physics-meaningful objects while maintaining efficient compilation.

Typical performance on a $256^3$ grid with $M=16$ Hermite moments achieves $\sim 0.5$ seconds per time step on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, enabling multi-hundred-eddy-turnover turbulence simulations within days. JAX implementations of scientific computing applications typically achieve 70--90\% of hand-optimized Fortran/C++ performance \citep{Bauer2021}, which we observe for GANDALF as well, while requiring substantially less development time through high-level array abstractions and automatic GPU compilation.

\subsection{Algorithm Summary}

We summarize the complete GANDALF algorithm for a single time step:

\STATE \textbf{Output:} Updated Fourier state $(\hat{w}^+_{n+1}, \hat{w}^-_{n+1}, \{\hat{g}^{\pm}_{m,n+1}\})$ at $t_{n+1}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This algorithm conserves energy to machine precision in exact arithmetic for the inviscid, collisionless limit ($\eta = \coll = 0$). Practical simulations exhibit $<0.01\%$ cumulative energy drift over hundreds of nonlinear times due to finite time-step truncation errors and dealiasing. The spectral representation combined with second-order temporal integration and properly dealiased nonlinear terms yields a robust method for long-time turbulence simulation across the KRMHD parameter space.
